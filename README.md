# Data-Science-Practices-and-Skilled-oriented-Projects

Welcome to my personal repository where I showcase my work in data science and related fields. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills and knowledge in machine learning, deep learning, AI, and different programming languages and software.

For a comprehensive look at what I can do in the field of data science, be sure to check out my [IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certification project](https://github.com/Feem-NS/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certification/tree/main/IBM-Module-10%20Applied-Data-Science-Capstone%20(Project)). It provides a thorough overview of my abilities and a well-presented end-to-end project.

I'm always eager to learn and expand my skills, so I'll be updating this repository with more exciting projects in the future. Stay tuned!

I've been actively honing my skills in these areas: spreadsheets, SQL databases, coding in R, Julia, and Python, object-oriented programming, optimization, exploratory data analysis, data extraction through web scraping and APIs, data cleaning, data transformation, data visualization, statistics and probability, modeling and simulation, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and dashboard creation.
